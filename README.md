# Overview
This project analyzes Yelp restaurant data in New York City. The analysis shows a competitive landscape in the NYC restaurant industry, with many options in cuisines, prices and restaurant offerings.

# Business Problem
Restaurant investors who specialize in both Thai and Mexican cuisines need data analysis to see which cuisine would be more successful in New York City. Data shows that both types of cuisines are abundant in the city, which required a deeper analysis to determine which type of restaurant would be a better investment. 

# Data
The Yelp Fusion API allows users to retrieve various data regarding different businesses. Every business has descriptive data associated with its business including a unique id, price, rating, etc. Additionally, each business has review data associated with it, which included a unique review id, date the review was created, and the text. In order to have a deep analysis, both business and review data for several businesses were pulled and analyzed.

# Methods
This project uses various data exploration methodologies in order to utilize data and provide investment recommendation. 

# Results

Most Thai and Mexican restaurants fall withing the one-to-two-dollar sign pricing, this creating an opportunity for a more upscale restaurant in the three or more dollar sign price range.

The majority of restaurants in either cuisine type offer both pickup and delivery options. The lack of Thai and Mexican restaurants offering reservations leads to room for growth for restaurants with dine-in services. The demand for dine-in services is likely to grow post COVID-19.

Out of our 1000 restaurant sample, roughly 12% (116 restaurants) rated higher than a 4.0 and received above 100 reviews. Of those, most were Thai restaurants, showing room for higher quality Mexican Restaurants.

# Conclusion 

This analysis leads to three recommendations potential restaurant investments in New York City:
<ul>
  <li> Design a restaurant catered towards a more upscale experience. The majority of Thai and Mexican restaurants are at a lower price point, which creates opportunity for higher priced restaurants.</li>
  <li> Offer a dine-in experience which allows for making reservations. Currently, the Thai and Mexican restaurant is flooded with pickup and delivery options, not leaving enough room for those who enjoy the dine-in experience.</li>
  <li> Focus on the Mexican Cuisine Industry. Due to the volume of Thai restaurants with high ratings and reviews, the Mexican restaurant industry offers less competition based on the higher quality metric.</li>
</ul>

# Next Steps

Further analysis could benefit from the following:
<ul>
  <li> Thorough analysis on costs of running a restaurant (e.g., ingredient costs, staff costs, real-estate, licensing, etc.)</li>
  <li> Numerical price data in order to have a more detailed analysis </li>
  <li> Get full text of each review to allow further analysis on customer satisfaction</li>
</ul>
